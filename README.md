## ✏️ Customize

You can edit the HTML content and Tailwind utility classes to:

- Change colors
- Update layout sections
- Add your personal information
- Modify typography and spacing

If your Tailwind classes are not already processed (e.g., if you’ve included the Tailwind CDN), you can also set up Tailwind locally:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then build your CSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```
